COVID FLIP
     
 Our website name is Covid Flip. Our main idea during this time is provide enough information about current pandemic situations to the people. 
 We used ECLIPSE, RESTAPI, MYSQL for maintaining backend of the project and VISUAL STUDIOS, HTML, CSS AND BOOTSTRAP for maintaining frontend of our project.
 The main flow of our project is, our main homepage contains few details about our site, few important symptoms of Covid-19 to create good awareness among the people. In the navigation bar of our homepage, we included hospitals, contacts, notifications and login wherein hospitals provide all the details of different hospitals available for the treatment and testing of COVID -19. Contacts provide details of different contact details for different states. Notifications are provided for getting latest updates of various new information.
             Login redirects us to login page where we need to provide username and password. This is mainly provided to upload the information into database. This access is provided only for a particular person who is the admin of the site. Hence, we used username as admin and also password as admin.
            Logging in as admin redirects us to main dashboard wherein, we provided an opportunity for the admin to save the details into MySQL database. Here we are giving way to update contacts, notifications and hospital details.
           Hence, the main flow of our site is admin stores the information of hospitals, notifications, contacts and these can be viewed by all the members viewing the site.
